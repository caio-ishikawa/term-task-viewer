==========

<img src="https://s11.gifyu.com/images/SgQes.gif">

TTV (term-task-viewer) is a lightweight tool to view and manage active processes in Unix machines. It provides an easy interface with vim-like commands, which allows you to easily filter and monitor processes without leaving the terminal, and without wasting unnecessary resources.

⚠️ WARNING: Still under development and likely to contain bugs. ⚠️

Design Goals
------------
- Minimal interface with vim-like commands.
- Filter by memory usage and cpu usage, as well as by process name using a reactive UI.
- Update information in real-time.
